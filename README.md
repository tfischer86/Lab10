### First A/B

There were two users from Pakistan for a few minutes but I didnt have the A / B test running. Might have given some real data lol idk

### Second Feature

Moved the settings to the left side of the header, to see which side gets clicked more often. But in the fake a / b test I used mobile and it was easier to tap the icon on the right side.
